Image segmentation software written by Jens Krog, Lund University, 2020.

This repository holds MATLAB software which performs image segmentation based on photo physics, i.e. knowledge of the background image count distribution.

By running the "segmentation_skeleton.m" routine will initiate segmentation of the "lung_sample.tif" image.

In order to use the framework for other images, the optics and chip parameters for the image acquisition setup must be supplied via an ".txt" files as is done here. A simple method for chip parameter calibration is described in XX.
